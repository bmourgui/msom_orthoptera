abstract = {Summary 1. Numbers of individuals or species are often recorded to test for variations in abundance or richness between treatments, habitat types, ecosystem management types, experimental treatments, time periods, etc. However, a difference in mean detectability among treatments is likely to lead to the erroneous conclusion that mean abundance differs among treatments. No guidelines exist to determine the maximum acceptable difference in detectability. 2. In this study, we simulated count data with imperfect detectability for two treatments with identical mean abundance (N) and number of plots (nplots) but different mean detectability (p). We then estimated the risk of erroneously concluding that N differed between treatments because the difference in p was ignored. The magnitude of the risk depended on p, N and nplots. 3. Our simulations showed that even small differences in p can dramatically increase this risk. A detectability difference as small as 4–8\% can lead to a 50–90\% risk of erroneously concluding that a significant difference in N exists among treatments with identical N = 50 and nplots = 50. Yet, differences in p of this magnitude among treatments or along gradients are commonplace in ecological studies. 4. Fortunately, simple methods of accounting for imperfect detectability prove effective at removing detectability difference between treatments. 5. Considering the high sensitivity of statistical tests to detectability differences among treatments, we conclude that accounting for detectability by setting up a replicated design, applied to at least part of the design scheme and analysing data with appropriate statistical tools, is always worthwhile when comparing count data (abundance, richness).},

abstract = {Abstract The estimation of Acridid (Orthoptera: Acrididae) density is the goal of a wide variety of conservation studies to monitor the impacts of grassland management or habitat change. The first aim of this paper was to study the influence of surveyors, time of the day and size/form of the box quadrat method on density values of Acridids in grassland habitats in Western France. The main taxa were Calliptamus italicus (L.) and Gomphocerinae sub-family. Surveyor and day-time (early morning vs. mid-day) were not significantly influencing the density values of Acridids produced using a 1 m2 box quadrat. A smaller box quadrat of 0.5 m2, square or rectangular, produced underestimates of Acridid density, such as square 1 m2 box quadrat should be preferred. Population densities change through time. Thus, data-based inferences about density are tied to the time periods during which data are collected. This was the main focus of this paper to provide a description of Acridid density fluctuations from egg hatching to adult’s death in grasslands with differing vegetation structures and grasshopper densities. Acridid densities were monitored weekly in 23 grassland plots over three seasons from 2004 to 2006. Weibull formulation was used to model density fluctuations for the two main taxa in each field with the Julian date as time. Phenological parameters of density were quite similar for the two taxa in the three years. This could be explained by similar meteorological conditions in the three years. However, these parameters exhibited a great variability between fields in the same year. Divergences between the fields could be attributable to different field ecological characters and to different grasshopper associations in the case of Gomphocerinae sub-family. This study provided data which may be useful in determining the optimum survey dates.},

abstract = {Abstract This review examines the direct effects of climate change on insect herbivores. Temperature is identified as the dominant abiotic factor directly affecting herbivorous insects. There is little evidence of any direct effects of CO2 or UVB. Direct impacts of precipitation have been largely neglected in current research on climate change. Temperature directly affects development, survival, range and abundance. Species with a large geographical range will tend to be less affected. The main effect of temperature in temperate regions is to influence winter survival; at more northerly latitudes, higher temperatures extend the summer season, increasing the available thermal budget for growth and reproduction. Photoperiod is the dominant cue for the seasonal synchrony of temperate insects, but their thermal requirements may differ at different times of year. Interactions between photoperiod and temperature determine phenology; the two factors do not necessarily operate in tandem. Insect herbivores show a number of distinct life-history strategies to exploit plants with different growth forms and strategies, which will be differentially affected by climate warming. There are still many challenges facing biologists in predicting and monitoring the impacts of climate change. Future research needs to consider insect herbivore phenotypic and genotypic flexibility, their responses to global change parameters operating in concert, and awareness that some patterns may only become apparent in the longer term.},

Habitat quality is not easily directly assessed within these complex systems, necessitating the identification of indicator species. This can be done using the IndVal technique, which identifies ecological indicators based on a site typology (e.g. habitat type or disturbance state). We used the extensive South African ENs of natural grassland within an exotic timber plantation matrix as a model system. Grasshoppers were used as potential indicators, as they are sensitive to habitat characteristics of ENs. Multivariate ordination techniques, cluster analyses and IndVal analyses were used to arrive at a site typology with associated indicator species. We retroactively associated these site types to their distinguishing variables. Eleven of 24 grasshopper species were effective indicators of characteristics of ENs, particularly grass height, number of years since last burn, bare ground and EN context. With the inclusion of more variables, site separation became more complete. Validating the selected indicator species on an independent dataset, three species were identified as indicative of high-quality habitat. We conclude that, while grasshoppers are sensitive indicators of habitat quality in ENs, small datasets are insufficient to detect these changes. Furthermore, grasshopper collection as an assessment technique of ENs may only be practicable as long as the bioindication system is developed from a large enough dataset as determined by species accumulation curves."

abstract = {Recent technological and methodological advances have revolutionized wildlife monitoring. Although most biodiversity monitoring initiatives are geared towards focal species of conservation concern, researchers are increasingly studying entire communities, specifically the spatiotemporal drivers of community size and structure and interactions among species. This has resulted in the emergence of multi-species occupancy models (MSOMs) as a promising and efficient approach for the study of community ecology. Given the potential of MSOMs for conservation and management action, it is critical to know whether study design and model assumptions are consistent with inference objectives. This is especially true for studies that are designed for a focal species but can give insights about a community. Here, we review the recent literature on MSOMs, identify areas of improvement in the multi-species study workflow, and provide a reference model for best practices for focal species and community monitoring study design. We reviewed 92 studies published between 2009 and early 2018, spanning 27 countries and a variety of taxa. There is a consistent under-reporting of details that are central to determining the adequacy of designs for generating data that can be used to make inferences about community-level patterns of occupancy, including the spatial and temporal extent, types of detectors used, covariates considered, and choice of field methods and statistical tools. This reporting bias could consequently result in skewed estimates, affecting conservation actions and management plans. On the other hand, comprehensive reporting is likely to help researchers working on MSOMs assess the robustness of inferences, in addition to making strides in terms of reproducibility and reusability of data. We use our literature review to inform a roadmap with best practices for MSOM studies, from simulations to design considerations and reporting, for the collection of new data as well as those involving existing datasets.}

abstract = {A statistical model is developed for estimating species richness and accumulation by formulating these community-level attributes as functions of model-based estimators of species occurrence while accounting for imperfect detection of individual species. The model requires a sampling protocol wherein repeated observations are made at a collection of sample locations selected to be representative of the community. This temporal replication provides the data needed to resolve the ambiguity between species absence and nondetection when species are unobserved at sample locations. Estimates of species richness and accumulation are computed for two communities, an avian community and a butterfly community. Our model-based estimates suggest that detection failures in many bird species were attributed to low rates of occurrence, as opposed to simply low rates of detection. We estimate that the avian community contains a substantial number of uncommon species and that species richness greatly exceeds the number of species actually observed in the sample. In fact, predictions of species accumulation suggest that even doubling the number of sample locations would not have revealed all of the species in the community. In contrast, our analysis of the butterfly community suggests that many species are relatively common and that the estimated richness of species in the community is nearly equal to the number of species actually detected in the sample. Our predictions of species accumulation suggest that the number of sample locations actually used in the butterfly survey could have been cut in half and the asymptotic richness of species still would have been attained. Our approach of developing occurrence-based summaries of communities while allowing for imperfect detection of species is broadly applicable and should prove useful in the design and analysis of surveys of biodiversity.},

abstract = {A variety of processes are thought to be involved in the formation and dynamics of species assemblages. For example, various metacommunity theories are based on differences in the relative contributions of dispersal of species among local communities and interactions of species within local communities. Interestingly, metacommunity theories continue to be advanced without much empirical validation. Part of the problem is that statistical models used to analyze typical survey data either fail to specify ecological processes with sufficient complexity or they fail to account for errors in detection of species during sampling. In this paper, we describe a statistical modeling framework for the analysis of metacommunity dynamics that is based on the idea of adopting a unified approach, multispecies occupancy modeling, for computing inferences about individual species, local communities of species, or the entire metacommunity of species. This approach accounts for errors in detection of species during sampling and also allows different metacommunity paradigms to be specified in terms of species- and location-specific probabilities of occurrence, extinction, and colonization: all of which are estimable. In addition, this approach can be used to address inference problems that arise in conservation ecology, such as predicting temporal and spatial changes in biodiversity for use in making conservation decisions. To illustrate, we estimate changes in species composition associated with the species-specific phenologies of flight patterns of butterflies in Switzerland for the purpose of estimating regional differences in biodiversity.},

abstract = {Abstract Efforts to design monitoring regimes capable of detecting population trends can be thwarted by observational and economic constraints inherent to most biological surveys. Ensuring that limited resources are allocated efficiently requires evaluation of statistical power for alternative survey designs. We simulated the process of data collection on a landscape, where we initiated declines over 3 sample periods in species of varying prevalence and detectability. Changing occupancy levels were estimated using a technique that accounted for effects of false-negative errors on survey data. Declines were identified within a frequentist statistical framework, but the significance level was set at an optimal level rather than adhering to an arbitrary conventional threshold. By varying the number of sites sampled and repeat visits made, we show how managers can design an optimal monitoring regime that maximizes statistical power within fixed budget constraints. Results show that 2 to 3 visits/site are generally sufficient unless occupancy is very high or detectability is low. In both cases, the number of required visits increase. In an example of woodland bird monitoring in the Mt. Lofty Ranges, South Australia, we show that, although the budget required to monitor a relatively rare species of low detectability may be higher than that for a common, easily detectable species, survey design requirements for common species may be more stringent. We discuss implications for multi-species monitoring programs and application of our methods to more complex monitoring problems.},

Total species richness for an assemblage or site is a valuable measure in conservation monitoring and assessment, but protocols for sampling and species richness determination in wetland habitats such as ponds, bogs or mires remain largely unrefined. 2. Techniques for estimation of total richness of an assemblage based upon replicated sampling offer the opportunity to derive useful estimates of total richness based upon small numbers of samples, and limit sampling-derived disturbance which can be particularly problematic in small aquatic habitats. 3. We quantified the performance of eight of the most commonly encountered estimators of species richness for a variety of littoral zone macrofauna from ponds, comparing estimated richness to maximum richness derived from sampling. 4. Estimates using non-parametric techniques based on species incidence provided the most accurate and precise estimates. The estimators Chao 2 and incidence-based coverage estimator (ICE) from this category were reliable and consistent slight over-estimators; the abundance-based estimator Chao1 also performed well. 5. Species inventory based on relatively small numbers of samples might be significantly improved by use of non-parametric estimators for quantification of species richness. 6. Use of non-parametric estimators of species richness can assist biodiversity inventory by preventing erroneous rankings of habitat richness based upon observed species numbers from limited sampling.},

	abstract = {Orthoptera are an important biological component of grasslands as a crucial link in the food chain. Grazing, either by wild animals or livestock for human food production, exerts considerable influence on the Orthoptera of grasslands. For example, grazing prevents succession of open grasslands to scrub and forest, creates heterogeneity in sward height, and provides patches of bare earth through the action of livestock hooves breaking the vegetative cover. Grazing may also interact with other forms of grassland management such as burning to produce quite complex interactions which vary greatly between regions and Orthoptera species. Threats to grassland Orthoptera include overgrazing; conversely, abandonment of grazing can lead to the loss of open habitats vital to many species. It is important to have ungrazed areas to provide refuges for species negatively affected by grazing. Rotational management – moving domestic livestock between different pastures – will also allow a range of sward structures to develop over a landscape. The over-arching principle for grazing management should be to establish a heterogeneous sward with a range of sward heights and bare earth for oviposition/basking. In more extensive systems, patches of scrub can form habitat of woody vegetation for species such as bush crickets. The greatest diversity of habitats should provide the highest species richness.},

abstract = {Abstract Multispecies occupancy models can estimate species richness from spatially replicated multispecies detection/non-detection survey data, while accounting for imperfect detection. A model extension using data augmentation allows inferring the total number of species in the community, including those completely missed by sampling (i.e., not detected in any survey, at any site). Here we investigate the robustness of these estimates. We review key model assumptions and test performance via simulations, under a range of scenarios of species characteristics and sampling regimes, exploring sensitivity to the Bayesian priors used for model fitting. We run tests when assumptions are perfectly met and when violated. We apply the model to a real dataset and contrast estimates obtained with and without predictors, and for different subsets of data. We find that, even with model assumptions perfectly met, estimation of the total number of species can be poor in scenarios where many species are missed (>15\%–20\%) and that commonly used priors can accentuate overestimation. Our tests show that estimation can often be robust to violations of assumptions about the statistical distributions describing variation of occupancy and detectability among species, but lower-tail deviations can result in large biases. We obtain substantially different estimates from alternative analyses of our real dataset, with results suggesting that missing relevant predictors in the model can result in richness underestimation. In summary, estimates of total richness are sensitive to model structure and often uncertain. Appropriate selection of priors, testing of assumptions, and model refinement are all important to enhance estimator performance. Yet, these do not guarantee accurate estimation, particularly when many species remain undetected. While statistical models can provide useful insights, expectations about accuracy in this challenging prediction task should be realistic. Where knowledge about species numbers is considered truly critical for management or policy, survey effort should ideally be such that the chances of missing species altogether are low.},

Data sets of species detections are likely to suffer from false absence records. Depending on the type of survey, false positive records can also be a problem. Disregarding these observation errors may lead to important biases in model estimation as well as overconfidence about precision. The severity of the problem depends on the intensity of these errors and how they correlate with environmental characteristics (e.g. where species detectability strongly depends on habitat features). A powerful modelling framework that accounts for imperfect detection in the modelling of species distributions has developed in the last 10–15 yr. Fundamental to this framework is that data must be collected in a way that is informative about the observation process. For instance, such data can be in the form of multiple detection/non-detection records obtained from several visits/observers/detection methods at (at least) some of the sites, or from data on times to detection within a survey visit. The framework can extend to studying species’ range dynamics and the modelling of communities, as well as approaches for analysing data on abundance and multiple occupancy states (rather than binary presence/absence). This paper summarizes these modelling advances, discusses evidence about effects of imperfect detection and the difficulties of working with it, and concludes with the current outlook for future research and application of these methods.},

abstract = {Abstract In the last two decades, interest in species distribution models (SDMs) of plants and animals has grown dramatically. Recent advances in SDMs allow us to potentially forecast anthropogenic effects on patterns of biodiversity at different spatial scales. However, some limitations still preclude the use of SDMs in many theoretical and practical applications. Here, we provide an overview of recent advances in this field, discuss the ecological principles and assumptions underpinning SDMs, and highlight critical limitations and decisions inherent in the construction and evaluation of SDMs. Particular emphasis is given to the use of SDMs for the assessment of climate change impacts and conservation management issues. We suggest new avenues for incorporating species migration, population dynamics, biotic interactions and community ecology into SDMs at multiple spatial scales. Addressing all these issues requires a better integration of SDMs with ecological theory.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Assessing the probability that a given site is occupied by a species of interest is important to resource managers, as well as metapopulation or landscape ecologists. Managers require accurate estimates of the state of the system, in order to make informed decisions. Models that yield estimates of occupancy, while accounting for imperfect detection, have proven useful by removing a potentially important source of bias. To account for detection probability, multiple independent searches per site for the species are required, under the assumption that the species is available for detection during each search of an occupied site. 2. We demonstrate that when multiple samples per site are defined by searching different locations within a site, absence of the species from a subset of these spatial subunits induces estimation bias when locations are exhaustively assessed or sampled without replacement. 3. We further demonstrate that this bias can be removed by choosing sampling locations with replacement, or if the species is highly mobile over a short period of time. 4. Resampling an existing data set does not mitigate bias due to exhaustive assessment of locations or sampling without replacement. 5. Synthesis and applications. Selecting sampling locations for presence/absence surveys with replacement is practical in most cases. Such an adjustment to field methods will prevent one source of bias, and therefore produce more robust statistical inferences about species occupancy. This will in turn permit managers to make resource decisions based on better knowledge of the state of the system.},

abstract = {Abstract Aim Species often remain undetected at sites where they are present. However, the impact of imperfect detection on species distribution models (SDMs) is not fully appreciated. In this paper we evaluate the influence of imperfect detection on the calibration and discrimination capacity of SDMs. We compare the performance of three types of SDMs: (1) a technique based on presence–absence data, (2) a technique based on presence–background data, and (3) a technique based on detection/non-detection data that accounts for imperfect detection. Innovation We use simulations to evaluate the impacts of imperfect detection in SDMs. This allows us to assess model performance with respect to the true objective of the models: the estimation of species distributions. We study a range of scenarios of occupancy and detection based on ecologically plausible environmental relationships and identify the circumstances in which imperfect detection affects model calibration and discrimination. We show that imperfect detection can substantially reduce the inferential and predictive accuracy of presence–absence and presence–background methods that do not account for detectability. While calibration is always affected, the influence on discrimination depends on the relationship of detectability and environmental variables. Main conclusions The performance of a model should be assessed with respect to its objectives. Comparative studies that intend to assess the performance of an SDM by evaluating its ability to predict detections rather than presences fail to reveal the benefits of accounting for detectability. Disregarding imperfect detection can have severe consequences for SDM performance, and hence for the estimation of species distributions. To date, this issue has been largely ignored in the SDM literature. Simultaneously modelling occupancy and detection does not necessarily require a greater sampling effort, but rather that data are collected so that they are informative about detectability. We recommend that consideration of imperfect detection become standard practice for species distribution modelling.},

Additionally, climate change is increasingly affecting biotic communities in grasslands. In this study, we examine Orthoptera community shifts in response to land-use and climate change in three different grassland habitats in a Central European low mountain landscape. Orthoptera strongly responded to environmental changes between 1994 and 2015. Both annual and summer temperatures increased during the study period. Apart from climatic changes, the studied habitats were unequally affected by land-use change. Due to the continuity of habitat management, habitat quality has not substantially changed in calcareous and mesic grasslands. However, abandonment has frequently contributed to habitat deterioration in wet grasslands. Orthoptera species richness in the well-managed grassland types increased, while it did not change in wet grasslands. The increase in species richness was mainly caused by an expansion of habitat generalists and mobile species in response to global warming. In comparison, the number of habitat specialists and species with limited dispersal ability did not change in any of the grassland types. Species-turnover rates were higher in mesic and wet grasslands. Accordingly, we detected an increase of the Community Temperature Index (CTI) in these habitats. The results of our study imply that the response of Orthoptera communities to global warming depend on the quality and availability of suitable habitats. Hence, sustaining traditional land use in semi-natural grasslands and the establishment of dense habitat networks is essential to promote Orthoptera diversity."

We present a model that enables direct estimation of these parameters when the probability of detecting the species is less than 1. The model does not require any assumptions of process stationarity, as do some previous methods, but does require detection/nondetection data to be collected in a manner similar to Pollock's robust design as used in mark–recapture studies. Via simulation, we show that the model provides good estimates of parameters for most scenarios considered. We illustrate the method with data from monitoring programs of Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) in northern California and tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) in Minnesota, USA.},

Predicted negative effects of increased weather variation are found only for a few species, mostly plants and birds in empirical studies. Therefore, we investigated correlations between weather variability and patterns in occupancy, local colonisations and local extinctions (metapopulation metrics) across four groups of ectotherms: Odonata, Orthoptera, Lepidoptera, and Reptilia. We analysed data of 134 species on a 1×1 km-grid base, collected in the last 20 years from the Netherlands, combining standardised data and opportunistic data. We applied dynamic site-occupancy models and used the results as input for analyses of (i) trends in distribution patterns, (ii) the effect of temperature on colonisation and persistence probability, and (iii) the effect of years with extreme weather on all the three metapopulation metrics. All groups, except butterflies, showed more positive than negative trends in metapopulation metrics. We did not find evidence that the probability of colonisation or persistence increases with temperature nor that extreme weather events are reflected in higher extinction risks. We could not prove that weather extremes have visible and consistent negative effects on ectothermic species in temperate northern hemisphere. These findings do not confirm the general prediction that increased weather variability imperils biodiversity. We conclude that weather extremes might not be ecologically relevant for the majority of species. Populations might be buffered against weather variation (e.g. by habitat heterogeneity), or other factors might be masking the effects (e.g. availability and quality of habitat). Consequently, we postulate that weather extremes have less, or different, impact in real world metapopulations than theory and models suggest.},

Mown meadows and young abandoned meadows (3–5 years since the last cut) had the highest, young forests the lowest mean number of orthopteran species. The change in vegetation structure and the shading by woody plants are considered the most important drivers determining the orthopteran diversity response to abandonment. Well-targeted agri-environment schemes are needed to maintain extensive semi-natural hay meadows with the provision of compensation payments to support transitional stages (young and old abandoned meadows). A mowing regime with a supra-annual cycle (e.g. 3–5 years) could be a suitable management practice to reduce direct mortality due to mechanical mowing and to halt forest invasion."

Species can be difficult to detect when rare but, in general, how detection probabilities vary with abundance is unknown. We developed a new detectability model based on the time to detection of the first individual of a species. Based on this model, the predicted detection rate is proportional to a power function of abundance with a scaling exponent between zero and one that depends on clustering of individuals. We estimated the model parameters with data from three independent datasets: searches for chenopod shrub species and coins, experimental searches for planted seedlings, and frog surveys at multiple sites in sub-tropical forests of eastern Australia. Analyses based on the detection time and detection probability suggest that detection rate increases with abundance as predicted. The model provides a way to scale detection rates to cases of low abundance when direct estimation of detection rates is often impractical.},

The problem is how to compare data among inventories in which different methodologies or measures of sampling effort have been employed. The methods used here for bats may be applied to any other biological group. We fit two asymptotic models to species accumulation curves for bat inventories to evaluate local or within-community diversity (alpha) and landscape diversity (gamma) in central Veracruz, Mexico. 2. Species accumulation models allow us to: (i) measure within-inventory efficacy and completeness; (ii) obtain an estimate of species richness that is based on a standardized measure of sampling effort, which makes valid comparisons between inventories possible; and (iii) estimate the minimum sampling effort required to reach a satisfactory level of completeness. 3. The applied models fit well in all cases (r2 >  0·95). The linear dependence model predicted lower asymptotes and the Clench model predicted higher asymptotes than the observed species richness. These models are useful as predictors representing the lower and upper limits between which the true species richness value should lie. 4. Alpha diversity for bats in all vegetation communities (11–18 species) was lower than the gamma diversity (20 species), suggesting that species richness and the sampling effort required are related to environmental heterogeneity. 5. We propose that 90\% of the total fauna predicted by either of the models is an acceptable standardized value for comparing species richness between communities. 6. We assessed the within-inventory completeness as the proportion of the models’ asymptote, where 90\% is the desired minimum level of completeness. Except in palm stands, all bat inventories had an acceptable level of completeness, at least for the linear dependence model. 7. For conditions similar to those of our study area, the minimum effort required to obtain a satisfactory level of completeness is 5–18 nights for plant communities and 18 nights for more heterogeneous landscapes. 8. We make recommendations for improving the efficacy and completeness of bat surveys based on the application of species accumulation models.},

We then use the approach with occupancy and reproductive rate data from California Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) collected in the central Sierra Nevada during the breeding season of 2004 to illustrate the utility of the modeling approach.

We illustrate the modeling framework in the context of logistic regression and presence–absence data, but a similar hierarchical structure could also be used in many other types of applications. We first use simulated data to illustrate that the community component can improve parameterization of species-specific models especially for rare species, for which the data would be too sparse to be informative alone. We then apply the community model to real data on 500 diatom species to show that it has much greater predictive power than a collection of independent species-specific models. We use the modeling approach to show that roughly one-third of distance decay in community similarity can be explained by two variables characterizing water quality, rare species typically preferring nutrient-poor waters with high pH, and common species showing a more general pattern of resource use.},

We conclude that SDM techniques provide a valuable asset for forest managers. However, it is essential to consider uncertainties behind the use of future climate change scenarios."

abstract = {Abstract Biodiversity monitoring at large spatial and temporal scales is greatly needed in the context of global changes. Although insects are a species-rich group and are important for ecosystem functioning, they have been largely neglected in conservation studies and policies, mainly due to technical and methodological constraints. Sound detection, a nondestructive method, is easily applied within a citizen-science framework and could be an interesting solution for insect monitoring. However, it has not yet been tested at a large scale. We assessed the value of a citizen-science program in which Orthoptera species (Tettigoniidae) were monitored acoustically along roads. We used Bayesian model-averaging analyses to test whether we could detect widely known patterns of anthropogenic effects on insects, such as the negative effects of urbanization or intensive agriculture on Orthoptera populations and communities. We also examined site-abundance correlations between years and estimated the biases in species detection to evaluate and improve the protocol. Urbanization and intensive agricultural landscapes negatively affected Orthoptera species richness, diversity, and abundance. This finding is consistent with results of previous studies of Orthoptera, vertebrates, carabids, and butterflies. The average mass of communities decreased as urbanization increased. The dispersal ability of communities increased as the percentage of agricultural land and, to a lesser extent, urban area increased. Despite changes in abundances over time, we found significant correlations between yearly abundances. We identified biases linked to the protocol (e.g., car speed or temperature) that can be accounted for ease in analyses. We argue that acoustic monitoring of Orthoptera along roads offers several advantages for assessing Orthoptera biodiversity at large spatial and temporal extents, particularly in a citizen science framework.

abstract = "Alpine meadows have been exposed to relevant management shifts in the last decades, with changes in plant species composition and biodiversity losses often occurring in favor of augmented foraging capabilities, especially in marginal rural contexts. In this study, we analyzed the relationships among the plant species composition, biodiversity and forage value of meadows and two sets of variables, environmental and management ones, in a dairy district of the Central Italian Alps. Results indicate that management variables could only explain limited variability of the meadows under study: for instance, the number of cuts per year is available to justify the plant species composition and biodiversity of such coenoses. Moreover, the environmental variables better described the variability of responses, due to the harsh environmental constraints of the area under examination, located at high altitudes. The shared effects of the two sets explained larger variance than the management set alone, due to the complex relationships of environmental and management factors in the context. The forage value of meadows, an indicator of hay quality, was found negatively associated with the Shannon Index. This behavior highlights a known dilemma which especially refers to high altitude communities as the ones under study, clearly highlighting trade-offs between their production and biodiversity. Some taxa as Anthriscus sylvestris, Heracleum sphondylium and others critically unbalance the species composition of meadows, thus their overall biodiversity, at low altitudes. This finding, explainable by the late first cuttings commonly adopted by all farmers, suggests the eutrophication of coenoses. The management choices inspected did not reflect on the wide variability of meadows, but indeed they made possible to understand how this farming system should be deeply revised, with respect to environmental constraints and meadows’ fodder capabilities."

abstract = {Abstract Functional traits are increasingly being used to understand the response of species to environmental change and their effects on ecosystem functioning. However, some ecologically important traits, such as plant height, influence the probability of species detection during field surveys. Imperfect detection of species could therefore bias measures of functional trait composition and diversity, leading to incorrect estimates of trait–environment relationships due to a process of “detection filtering.” The importance of detection filtering for functional ecological studies remains unknown. We used hierarchical models that account for detection filtering to analyse data on 1,296 vascular plant species sampled in 362 1-km2 plots, distributed along a 2,460-m elevational gradient in Central Europe. We examined how detection filtering altered measures of functional diversity (multivariate functional richness and packing) and composition (community means of three traits). We also determined whether the strength of detection filtering varied over the gradient, to determine whether detection filtering biased trait–environment relationships. Species detectability was correlated with all three functional traits tested in this study, meaning that short species with small seeds and high specific leaf area values were less likely to be detected. This suggests that imperfect detection has the potential to bias measures of functional composition. Generally, measures of functional composition were not strongly affected by detection filtering, but functional packing was underestimated when detection filtering was not accounted for. In addition to the traits, distributional characteristics were important; rare species and species occurring mainly at low elevations tended to have lower detection probabilities. Overall, detection filtering did not strongly bias trait–environment relationships because the effects of the environment on functional composition and diversity were larger than the effects of detection. Our results suggest that many measures of functional composition and diversity are robust to detection filtering, but some are likely biased. Functional ecologists should consider correcting for imperfect detection, and our approach provides a simple method to do so for a wide range of datasets.},

abstract = {Summary 1 The management of both desirable and undesirable species requires an understanding of the factors determining their distribution. Quantitative distribution models offer simple methods for formulating the species–habitat link and the means not only for predicting where species should occur, but also for understanding the factors involved. Generalized linear modelling, in particular, links the incidence of species to habitat variables, and has increasingly formed the backbone of the modelling approaches used. New ‘data technologies’, such as remote sensing and geographical information systems, have further broadened these modelling applications to almost any ecological system and any species for which there are distribution data. 2 Many previous approaches have aimed to identify the most parsimonious model with the best suite of predictors, selected on the basis of null hypothesis testing. However, information-theoretic approaches based on Akaike's information criterion allow the selection of a best approximating model or a subset of models from a set of candidates. Information-theoretic approaches require a deeper understanding of the biology of the system modelled and may well become an improved paradigm for species distribution modelling. 3 Synthesis and applications. This special profile of six papers demonstrates the development in methodology used in species distribution modelling. The papers show how information-theoretic approaches can be coupled with emerging data technologies to address issues of conservation significance. With conservation biology and applied ecology at the forefront of many of the basic science developments so far, we expect these methods to pervade other areas of ecological research more fully in future.},

abstract = {Summary Environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling can be a highly sensitive method for detecting aquatic taxa; however, the cost-efficiency of this technique relative to traditional methods has not been rigorously assessed. We show how methods that account for imperfect and stochastic detection can be used to (i) determine the optimal allocation of survey effort with eDNA sampling for a fixed budget (i.e. identify the optimal combination of water samples vs. site visits), and (ii) assess the cost-efficiency of eDNA sampling relative to traditional survey techniques. We illustrate this approach by comparing eDNA sampling and bottle-trapping for an exotic newt species (Lissotriton v. vulgaris) recently detected in Melbourne, Australia. Bottle traps produced much lower detection rates than eDNA sampling, but the cost-efficiency of the two methods can be similar because bottle-trapping is cheaper per sample. The relative cost-efficiency of the two sampling methods was sensitive to the available survey budget, the costs of eDNA primer/probe development and sample processing and the number of positive quantitative PCR assays (qPCRs) used to designate a water sample as positive for newt DNA. Environmental DNA sampling was more cost-efficient than bottle-trapping for small to intermediate budgets when primer/probe development and sample processing costs were low, and 1/4 or 2/4 positive qPCRs were used to label a water sample as positive for newt eDNA. However, bottle traps were generally more cost-efficient than eDNA sampling when primer/probe development and sample processing costs were high, regardless of qPCR threshold or survey budget. Traditional sampling methods may achieve lower detection probabilities compared to eDNA sampling, but the totality of costs can make eDNA sampling less efficient than traditional techniques in some circumstances. Our approach provides a quantitative framework for determining how many water samples and site visits are required to maximize detection probabilities with eDNA sampling, and can calculate the cost-efficiency of any sampling method.},

abstract = {Abstract Understanding patterns of diversity is central to ecology and conservation, yet estimates of diversity are often biased by imperfect detection. In recent years, multi-species occupancy models (MSOM) have been developed as a statistical tool to account for species-specific heterogeneity in detection while estimating true measures of diversity. Although the power of these models has been tested in various ways, their ability to estimate gamma diversity—or true community size, N is a largely unrecognized feature that needs rigorous evaluation. We use both simulations and an empirical dataset to evaluate the bias, precision, accuracy and coverage of estimates of N from MSOM compared to the widely applied iChao2 non-parametric estimator. We simulated 5,600 datasets across seven scenarios of varying average occupancy and detectability covariates, as well as varying numbers of sites, replicates and true community size. Additionally, we use a real dataset of surveys over 9 years (where species accumulation reached an asymptote, indicating true N), to estimate N from each annual survey. Simulations showed that both MSOM and iChao2 estimators are generally accurate (i.e. unbiased and precise) except under unideal scenarios where mean species occupancy is low. In such scenarios, MSOM frequently overestimated N. Across all scenarios, MSOM estimates were less certain than iChao2, but this led to over-confident iChao2 estimates that showed poor coverage. Results from the real dataset largely confirmed the simulation findings, with MSOM estimates showing greater accuracy and coverage than iChao2. Community ecologists have a wide choice of analytical methods, and both iChao2 and MSOM estimates of N are substantially preferable to raw species counts. The simplicity of non-parametric estimators has obvious advantages, but our results show that in many cases, MSOM may provide superior estimates that also account more accurately for uncertainty. Both methods can show strong bias when average occupancy is very low, and practitioners should show caution when using estimates derived from either method under such conditions.}

We show that false-negative errors (failure to record a species when in fact it is present) can have a significant impact on statistical estimation of habitat models using simulated data. Then we introduce an extension of logistic modeling, the zero-inflated binomial (ZIB) model that permits the estimation of the rate of false-negative errors and the correction of estimates of the probability of occurrence for false-negative errors by using repeated visits to the same site. Our simulations show that even relatively low rates of false negatives bias statistical estimates of habitat effects. The method with three repeated visits eliminates the bias, but estimates are relatively imprecise. Six repeated visits improve precision of estimates to levels comparable to that achieved with conventional statistics in the absence of false-negative errors. In general, when error rates are ≤50\% greater efficiency is gained by adding more sites, whereas when error rates are >50\% it is better to increase the number of repeated visits. We highlight the flexibility of the method with three case studies, clearly demonstrating the effect of false-negative errors for a range of commonly used survey methods.},

abstract = {Summary 1 Species distribution models could bring manifold benefits across ecology, but require careful testing to prove their reliability and guide users. Shortcomings in testing are often evident, failing to reflect recent methodological developments and changes in the way models are applied. We considered some of the fundamental issues. 2 Generalizability is a basic requirement for predictive models, describing their capacity to produce accurate predictions with new data, i.e. in real applications beyond model training. Tests of generalizability should be as rigorous as possible: ideally using a large number of independent test sites (≥ 200–300) that represent anticipated applications. Bootstrapping identifies the role of overfitting of the training data in limiting a model's generalizability. 3 Predictions from most distribution models are continuous variables. Their accuracy may be described by discrimination and calibration components. Discriminatory ability describes how well a model separates occupied from unoccupied sites. It is independent of species prevalence and is readily comparable between models. Rank correlation coefficients, such as the concordance index, are effective measures. 4 Calibration describes the numerical accuracy of predictions (e.g. whether 40\% of sites with predicted probabilities of 0·40 are occupied) but is frequently overlooked in model testing. Poor calibration could mislead any conservation efforts utilizing models to estimate the ‘value’ of different sites for a given species. Effective assessments can be made using smoothed calibration plots. 5 The effects of species prevalence on nominal presence–absence predictions are well known. The currently preferred accuracy measure, Cohen's κ, has weaknesses. We argue that mutual information measures, based in information theory, may be more appropriate. 6 Synthesis and applications. Model evaluation must be informative and should ideally: (i) define generalizability in detail; (ii) separate the discrimination and calibration components of accuracy and test both; (iii) adopt assessment techniques that permit more valid intermodel comparisons; (iv) avoid nominal presence–absence evaluation where possible and consider information-theoretic measures; and (v) utilize the full range of techniques to help diagnose the causes of prediction problems. Few modellers in applied ecology and conservation biology satisfy these needs, making it difficult for others to evaluate models and identify potential misuses. The problems are real, and if uncorrected will damage conservation efforts through the inaccurate assessment of distribution and habitat preferences of important organisms.},

Here, we investigated population dynamics of the Australian plague locust, Chortoicetes terminifera, using density data collected between 1988 and 2010 by the Australian Plague Locust Commission over more than 3 million km2 in eastern Australia. We applied multistate and autologistic multi-season occupancy models to test competing hypotheses about environmental and demographic processes affecting the large-scale dynamics of the Australian plague locust. We found that rainfall and land cover predictors best explained the spatial variability in outbreak probability across eastern Australia. Outbreaks are more likely to occur in temperate than tropical regions, with a faster and more continuous response to rainfall in desert than in agricultural areas. Our results also support the hypothesis that migration tends to propagate outbreaks only locally (over distances lower than 400 km) rather than across climatic regions. Our study suggests that locust outbreak forecasting and management systems could be improved by implementing key environmental factors and migration in hierarchical spatial models. Finally, our modeling framework can be seen as a step towards bridging the gap between mechanistic and more phenomenological models in the spatial analysis of fluctuating populations.},

One method for predicting richness and other summaries of community structure is to develop species-specific models of occurrence probability based on habitat or landscape characteristics. However, this approach can be challenging for rare or elusive species for which survey data are often sparse. 2. Recent developments have allowed for improved inference about community structure based on species-specific models of occurrence probability, integrated within a hierarchical modelling framework. This framework offers advantages to inference about species richness over typical approaches by accounting for both species-level effects and the aggregated effects of landscape composition on a community as a whole, thus leading to increased precision in estimates of species richness by improving occupancy estimates for all species, including those that were observed infrequently. 3. We developed a hierarchical model to assess the community response of breeding birds in the Hudson River Valley, New York, to habitat fragmentation and analysed the model using a Bayesian approach. 4. The model was designed to estimate species-specific occurrence and the effects of fragment area and edge (as measured through the perimeter and the perimeter/area ratio, P/A), while accounting for imperfect detection of species. 5. We used the fitted model to make predictions of species richness within forest fragments of variable morphology. The model revealed that species richness of the observed bird community was maximized in small forest fragments with a high P/A. However, the number of forest interior species, a subset of the community with high conservation value, was maximized in large fragments with low P/A. 6.  Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate the importance of understanding the responses of both individual, and groups of species, to environmental heterogeneity while illustrating the utility of hierarchical models for inference about species richness for conservation. This framework can be used to investigate the impacts of land-use change and fragmentation on species or assemblage richness, and to further understand trade-offs in species-specific occupancy probabilities associated with landscape variability.},

abstract = {Abstract Recent methodological advances permit the estimation of species richness and occurrences for rare species by linking species-level occurrence models at the community level. The value of such methods is underscored by the ability to examine the influence of landscape heterogeneity on species assemblages at large spatial scales. A salient advantage of community-level approaches is that parameter estimates for data-poor species are more precise as the estimation process “borrows” from data-rich species. However, this analytical benefit raises a question about the degree to which inferences are dependent on the implicit assumption of relatedness among species. Here, we assess the sensitivity of community/group-level metrics, and individual-level species inferences given various classification schemes for grouping species assemblages using multispecies occurrence models. We explore the implications of these groupings on parameter estimates for avian communities in two ecosystems: tropical forests in Puerto Rico and temperate forests in northeastern United States. We report on the classification performance and extent of variability in occurrence probabilities and species richness estimates that can be observed depending on the classification scheme used. We found estimates of species richness to be most precise and to have the best predictive performance when all of the data were grouped at a single community level. Community/group-level parameters appear to be heavily influenced by the grouping criteria, but were not driven strictly by total number of detections for species. We found different grouping schemes can provide an opportunity to identify unique assemblage responses that would not have been found if all of the species were analyzed together. We suggest three guidelines: (1) classification schemes should be determined based on study objectives; (2) model selection should be used to quantitatively compare different classification approaches; and (3) sensitivity of results to different classification approaches should be assessed. These guidelines should help researchers apply hierarchical community models in the most effective manner.},

abstract = {Abstract While multi-species occupancy models (MSOMs) are emerging as a popular method for analyzing biodiversity data, formal checking and validation approaches for this class of models have lagged behind. Concurrent with the rise in application of MSOMs among ecologists, a quiet regime shift is occurring in Bayesian statistics where predictive model comparison approaches are experiencing a resurgence. Unlike single-species occupancy models that use integrated likelihoods, MSOMs are usually couched in a Bayesian framework and contain multiple levels. Standard model checking and selection methods are often unreliable in this setting and there is only limited guidance in the ecological literature for this class of models. We examined several different contemporary Bayesian hierarchical approaches for checking and validating MSOMs and applied these methods to a freshwater aquatic study system in Colorado, USA, to better understand the diversity and distributions of plains fishes. Our findings indicated distinct differences among model selection approaches, with cross-validation techniques performing the best in terms of prediction.},

Despite this, most wildlife still lives outside protected areas on private agricultural land, particularly on rangeland used for livestock grazing. Understanding which species persist and which decline in agricultural landscapes is important for global biodiversity monitoring, management and conservation. In this study, we used hierarchical multi-species occupancy modelling to estimate terrestrial vertebrate (body mass > 0.5 kg) richness in the Karoo, a semi-arid region of South Africa. We evaluated species-specific responses to different anthropogenic and environmental variables in rangeland and a nearby protected area of similar size. We grouped mammal species according to trophic guild and body size and compared their occurrence between areas. In total we detected 42 species over 4035 6-day pooled trap nights across 322 sites. Community species richness was not significantly different between the two types of land use and decreased with increasing elevation in the protected area. Human disturbance did not affect individual species occupancy in either area. Carnivores, omnivores and medium-sized species occupancy probabilities were similar between the two areas but were higher for herbivores and large species in the protected area and for insectivores and small species in rangeland. Our results reveal that drylands in the South African Karoo region, including rangeland used for small-livestock farming, support a diverse community of terrestrial vertebrates. Private landowners are thus important custodians of key components of indigenous biodiversity outside of protected areas, especially in low-lying areas."

abstract = {Summary. We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the ‘hat’ matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

abstract = {The ability to accurately predict patterns of species' occurrences is fundamental to the successful management of animal communities. To determine optimal management strategies, it is essential to understand species–habitat relationships and how species habitat use is related to natural or human-induced environmental changes. Using five years of monitoring data in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, Maryland, USA, we developed four multispecies hierarchical models for estimating amphibian wetland use that account for imperfect detection during sampling. The models were designed to determine which factors (wetland habitat characteristics, annual trend effects, spring/summer precipitation, and previous wetland occupancy) were most important for predicting future habitat use. We used the models to make predictions about species occurrences in sampled and unsampled wetlands and evaluated model projections using additional data. Using a Bayesian approach, we calculated a posterior distribution of receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) values, which allowed us to explicitly quantify the uncertainty in the quality of our predictions and to account for false negatives in the evaluation data set. We found that wetland hydroperiod (the length of time that a wetland holds water), as well as the occurrence state in the prior year, were generally the most important factors in determining occupancy. The model with habitat-only covariates predicted species occurrences well; however, knowledge of wetland use in the previous year significantly improved predictive ability at the community level and for two of 12 species/species complexes. Our results demonstrate the utility of multispecies models for understanding which factors affect species habitat use of an entire community (of species) and provide an improved methodology using AUC that is helpful for quantifying the uncertainty in model predictions while explicitly accounting for detection biases.},

abstract = "With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species’ response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone."

abstract = {Abstract Species distribution models (SDMs) are used to inform a range of ecological, biogeographical and conservation applications. However, users often underestimate the strong links between data type, model output and suitability for end-use. We synthesize current knowledge and provide a simple framework that summarizes how interactions between data type and the sampling process (i.e. imperfect detection and sampling bias) determine the quantity that is estimated by a SDM. We then draw upon the published literature and simulations to illustrate and evaluate the information needs of the most common ecological, biogeographical and conservation applications of SDM outputs. We find that, while predictions of models fitted to the most commonly available observational data (presence records) suffice for some applications, others require estimates of occurrence probabilities, which are unattainable without reliable absence records. Our literature review and simulations reveal that, while converting continuous SDM outputs into categories of assumed presence or absence is common practice, it is seldom clearly justified by the application's objective and it usually degrades inference. Matching SDMs to the needs of particular applications is critical to avoid poor scientific inference and management outcomes. This paper aims to help modellers and users assess whether their intended SDM outputs are indeed fit for purpose.},

abstract = {Most methods for modeling species distributions from occurrence records require additional data representing the range of environmental conditions in the modeled region. These data, called background or pseudo-absence data, are usually drawn at random from the entire region, whereas occurrence collection is often spatially biased toward easily accessed areas. Since the spatial bias generally results in environmental bias, the difference between occurrence collection and background sampling may lead to inaccurate models. To correct the estimation, we propose choosing background data with the same bias as occurrence data. We investigate theoretical and practical implications of this approach. Accurate information about spatial bias is usually lacking, so explicit biased sampling of background sites may not be possible. However, it is likely that an entire target group of species observed by similar methods will share similar bias. We therefore explore the use of all occurrences within a target group as biased background data. We compare model performance using target-group background and randomly sampled background on a comprehensive collection of data for 226 species from diverse regions of the world. We find that target-group background improves average performance for all the modeling methods we consider, with the choice of background data having as large an effect on predictive performance as the choice of modeling method. The performance improvement due to target-group background is greatest when there is strong bias in the target-group presence records. Our approach applies to regression-based modeling methods that have been adapted for use with occurrence data, such as generalized linear or additive models and boosted regression trees, and to Maxent, a probability density estimation method. We argue that increased awareness of the implications of spatial bias in surveys, and possible modeling remedies, will substantially improve predictions of species distributions.},

abstract = {Site occupancy models have been developed that allow for imperfect species detection or “false negative” observations. Such models have become widely adopted in surveys of many taxa. The most fundamental assumption underlying these models is that “false positive” errors are not possible. That is, one cannot detect a species where it does not occur. However, such errors are possible in many sampling situations for a number of reasons, and even low false positive error rates can induce extreme bias in estimates of site occupancy when they are not accounted for. In this paper, we develop a model for site occupancy that allows for both false negative and false positive error rates. This model can be represented as a two-component finite mixture model and can be easily fitted using freely available software. We provide an analysis of avian survey data using the proposed model and present results of a brief simulation study evaluating the performance of the maximum-likelihood estimator and the naive estimator in the presence of false positive errors.},
